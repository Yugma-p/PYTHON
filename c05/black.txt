A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.
 The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[3][4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. 
 Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.
